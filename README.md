# Spin the Bottle!

This is my first little project written in JS. The code is far from beautiful and efficient but it works ;) 

Usage:

- First: Enter the number of players
- Second: Enter the player names
- Third: Click on the arrow to spin
- Fourth: Wait 6 Seconds for spinning animation to complete
- Fifth: Read and do challenge
- Sixth: Click close
- Seventh: Spin again!

Notes:

- WARNING: The prompts/challenges are in german and contain content, that is not minor-friendly.
- WARNING: Reloading the page resets everything (player number, player names, challege progress).
- The game contains 159 challenges including prompts, questions, wildcards rulecards and simple drink-cards.
- Every challenge is only shown ONCE except wildcards, rulecards and drink-cards.
- Before beginning the game, place your phone/tablet with the top facing to the player whose name was entered first.
- When a wildcard pops up the spinner can decide what the challenge consists of.
- When a rulecard pops up the spinner has to set up a rule which the whole group has to follow for the rest of the game.
- When a drink-card pops up the spinner has to drink :).


HAVE FUN!!!!
